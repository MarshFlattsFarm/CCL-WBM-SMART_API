The sub-directories and files under this directory are example responses from
a Circontrol WallBox Smart (CCL-WBM-SMART) EVSE unit, running firware v2.3b.

These were created by making HTTP requests using 'wget' on Linux, to URLs
such as:
  
  http://192.168.1.11/services/chargePointsInterface/devices.xml

The returned XML from this call is saved as:
services/chargePointsInterface/devices.xml

The XML has had newline characters and indentation added to make it easier
to read.
