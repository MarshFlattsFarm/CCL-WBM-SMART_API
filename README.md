# Introduction

This GitHub repository contains information and examples relating to the 
Circutor PowerStudio HTTP API implemented in some Circontrol EVSE units
such as their WallBox Smart series.

It seems that Circontrol used the Circutor PowerStudio environment to develop
a PowerStudio *Application* called CirCarLife (sometimes abbreviated to CCL).
The smart EVSE units run the CirCarLife *Engine* software (on the CCL1Mini 
processor board).
